So uh, at first the question kind of threw me off but it turned out to be a minor Math related problem.
The trick here is to utilize the good 'ole logarithms.
For a fact, we know that (3^n) is congruent to 0(mod 3). Plus, we know that (3^n) equals to some number say X.
So we can formulate that (3^n) = X. X is the number we are given for this case. Now, if X is truly a power of 3,
then we should have n as an integer. What's left is solving for n. Applying log both sides results into
	=> (3^n) = X
	=> n log 3 = log X
	=> n = log X / log 3
Now, if n is an integer(not an improper fraction), then X is truly the power. Else, its not.
